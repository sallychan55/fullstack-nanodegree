# Neighborhood Map
The map shows sweets shops around me. The map is built by Google Map API and attached contents by [Yelp API(v2)](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview).
Moreover [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/) allows us to filter markers in map and shops in a sidebar.

# How to run
It's simple! Open index.html after downloading with js and css folders.

After open the file, you will see map with shops.
you can do...:
* search a shop by typing name in a search box
* click a marker to see shop details
* see yelp review on a infomation window and jump to the yelp page
