# Neighborhood Map
The map shows sweets shops around me. The map is built by Google Map API and attached contents by Yelp API(v2).
Moreover Knockout JS allows us to filter markers in map and shop list in a sidebar.

# How to run
It's simple! Open sweetsmap.html after downloading with js and css folders.

After open the file, you will see map with shops.
you can do...:
* search a shop by typing name in a search box
* click a marker to see shop details
* see yelp review on a infomation window and jump to the yelp page
